Tired of receiving page notifications or being bothered by them asking permission to send notifications? Don't bother with that anymore!

## Requirements
* Firefox 58.0 or later


## Note
As many sites display notification requests to users to be able to send push notifications, [Firefox 72.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/72.0/releasenotes/) + now displays an icon builtin.

This Add-on brought that proposal of enabling or not the notifications in a easy way, but now with this new feature in Firefox, I will keep just security updates.

## How to test this Add-on

1. Clone this repository git clone ```https://github.com/jhonatasrm/nBother.git```
2. In the Firefox address bar type ```about:debugging```
3. Click ```Load Temporary Add-on```, a dialog window opens
4. In the cloned repository, select the ```manifest.json``` file. The webextension icon will appear in your toolbar
