## Future updates
As many sites display notification requests to users to be able to send push notifications, [Firefox 72.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/72.0/releasenotes/) + now displays an icon builtin.

This Add-on brought that proposal of enabling or not the notifications in a easy way, but now with this new feature in Firefox, I will keep just security updates.
